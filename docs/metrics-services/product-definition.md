# Product Definition

> An editable version of the Product Definition is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18tqPRzVUzHOwHV_MJVtf4ewP7XH1Kr0QZQ_6B8St56k/edit?usp=sharing). Download a copy before continuing.

Product definition is the process of documenting the proposed solution in broad terms. The purpose of a product definition is to align expectations, formulate broad concepts, clarify roles, and establish a development timeline. In the next step, [Product Specification](), you will have a chance to provide more specifics. At the product definition stage, you still have considerable flexibility in how you will deliver the final solution.

Use the guidance below to complete the product definition. The product definition for this website is available [here]() as an example.

#### Solution Description

Provide a 1-2 sentence description of the proposed solution.

#### Goal & Objectives

##### Goal

The goal statement should describe the desired impact of the project. It should relate to your conservation targets. It should be observable. Optionally, it can be measurable and time-limited. The goal is not "to implement the solution", the goal is what happens if the solution is implemented successfully.

##### Objectives

1. Objectives describe a desired outcome for the project
2. Objectives are not an outline, list of features, are set of use cases
3. Try to have at least two and no more than five objectives

#### Users

##### Primary

Primary users are the subset of your boundary partners who will directly interact with the tool or solution. Think of these like your customers. You might want to group users with [personas](../additional-resources/persona-guide.md). For each primary user identified, complete the table below. If you've already completed the [scoping exercise](scoping.md), you will have a starting point. 

|               Problem Scenarios               |       Alternatives       |      Value Propositions      |
| :-------------------------------------------: | :----------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| What is the problem, need, or job to be done? | What are they doing now? | Why is your solution better? |

*Add a row to the table for each problem scenario.*

##### Secondary

Secondary users don't directly use the tool or solution, but are affected by it. They may provide data inputs or make decisions from the outputs. Repeat the process you went through for primary users.

|               Problem Scenarios               |       Alternatives       |      Value Propositions      |
| :-------------------------------------------: | :----------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| What is the problem, need, or job to be done? | What are they doing now? | Why is your solution better? |

#### Use Cases

Use cases describe the conditions under which the tool is used and the purpose for using the tool in that case. They should be fairly broad and together encompass the list of uses you envision for the tool or solution. 

If you're familiar with user stories, you can think of a use case as an 'epic' user story. During product specification you will enumerate more specific user stories to motivate development of features. However, if it's helpful, you can frame use cases like user stories as "As user X, I want to Y so I can Z." This helps you think through each use case (Y) as specific to a user (X) who is motivated by some factor (Z). 

#### Product Sketch

The six panels in this section allow you to get visual with how you expect the solution to work in practice. Visualizing can really help you avoid pitfalls and identify necessary features. Don't feel restricted to this six-panel format, feel free to get creative. Storyboards and Journey Maps are both great options for this sketch. Jot down any insights you had.

#### Design Principles & Constraints

List design principles and constraints. Consider integration, hosting, support, adaptive management and deployment but don't get into details yet. Your client may have constraints related to software licensing, budget, etc. Listing them here will make sure you don't come back with a solution that isn't feasible.

#### Conditions of Satisfaction

Set expectations for the tool by clarifying how you will know this tool is successful. 

#### Approach

Provide a general description of the proposed work plan. Discuss roles, timelines, and resources required.
